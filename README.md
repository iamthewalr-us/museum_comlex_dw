This repository includes code for the practical section of the thesis.

## Abstract

The Museum complex is a large private museum. Its collection accounts for 12,000 items and it welcomes over 20,000 tourists a month. As such it is capable of producing a large amount of data which can be used for business analytics and to support future decision making. However, due to several factors this data is not being collected and used as it potentially can be. This thesis is aimed at analyzing the current state of data collection in the Museum complex and to propose a solution to existing problem.

 Through studying previous experiences of other cultural centers, the proposed solution was defined as constructing a data warehouse that would allow to collect and store uniformed data from various sources. This project was focused around data related to tourist visits and ticket sales, but the proposed solution can be scaled to include other business processes that are of interest to the museum’s management.
 
This thesis includes theoretical research of the data warehouse concepts and existing architectures. It also includes practical implementation of the prototype of the data warehouse that later will be presented as a solution to the museum’s director and management team.
